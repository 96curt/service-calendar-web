# Service Scheduling Website
Computer Science Capstone at California State University, Chico.
Sponsored by Sierra Pacific Windows, a division of Sierra Pacific Industries.

This is repo is my front-end. The back-end is at https://github.com/96curt/service-calendar-rest

## Overview
 The Service Scheduler is an internal tool that I am developing for my sponsor and employer Sierra Pacific Windows. We are a manufacturer of windows and doors and are based in Red Bluff, CA. We ship our products nationwide to dealers or directly to customers. We also have a service department that has offices across the nation called service centers.

These service centers receive service requests from customers and schedule technicians to appointments to go customers homes or businesses to make repairs.

Staff at these service centers have many requests and technicians to manage and are in need of a new tool to better schedule technicians.


## Design
I am leveraging the preformance of Javascript and a REST API to build a fast and scalable scheduling tool.
